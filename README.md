# E-Robot German language files
This repo contains the German language files of the Android app [E-Robot] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bartat.android.robot).
I created this to keep track of all changes in the files and to monitor my progress. But if you want you can of course also report translation errors or other things here - or change them by yourself and create a pull request.

## Notes
This language files cannot be used to change the language of the compiled app. If you want to include a language into E-Robot you have to submit these XML files to the developer of E-Robot, so that he can compile a nw version of E-Robot with your new language included.

## About
E-Robot was created by [Tam√°s Barta] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Tam%C3%A1s+Barta).
The German translation was created by [rugk] (https://github.com/rugk).
